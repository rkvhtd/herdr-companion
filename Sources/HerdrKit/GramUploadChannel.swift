/// A streaming upload channel for ONE gram attachment — the file-transfer mirror
/// of `PaneInputChannel`. Holds a single SSH exec channel running
/// `herdr api-bridge --duplex` open for the upload's lifetime and writes
/// newline-delimited chunk frames to the daemon's `gram.upload.stream`, instead
/// of one `herdr api-bridge` exec per chunk.
///
/// Why this exists: the per-chunk path (`gram.upload_chunk`) costs an SSH channel
/// open, a non-login shell, a fresh `herdr` process, a unix-socket connect and a
/// teardown FOR EVERY CHUNK — 2133 of them for a 100 MB file, whose chunk size is
/// itself pinned at 48 KiB by the argv cap. Uploads are round-trip bound, not
/// bandwidth bound. One held channel with 512 KiB frames removes both limits.
///
/// Three deliberate differences from `PaneInputChannel`:
///
/// 1. The encoder must not escape `/`. Base64 is slash-dense (an all-`0xFF` chunk
///    is ALL `/`), and JSONEncoder's default escaping nearly doubles those bytes.
/// 2. `sendChunk` AWAITS the daemon's ack. Fire-and-forget is right for
///    keystrokes and catastrophic for a 100 MB file: the whole point of streaming
///    from disk is that resident memory stays at one chunk, which an unbounded
///    queue would undo. The ack is also the only place a rejected chunk can
///    surface, since an upload has no echo channel.
/// 3. `remoteError` carries a DECODED `APIError`, because the caller must tell
///    "this daemon has no such method" (fall back) from "offset mismatch" or
///    "another stream owns this upload" (do not).
