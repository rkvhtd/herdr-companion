/// token and the machine's SSH host-key fingerprint. The phone scans it, generates its own
/// keypair (`PairingKey`), and sends only the PUBLIC half here. The machine appends that to
/// `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and from then on the phone authenticates like any other host
/// entry.
///
/// WHAT PROTECTS THIS EXCHANGE. It is a plaintext line-oriented protocol, deliberately:
/// `herdr pair` binds to the machine's Tailscale address, so the bytes travel inside
/// WireGuard, and the listener is not reachable from the internet at all. The token is
/// single-use and short-lived, so a photograph of the QR is worthless once redeemed. The
