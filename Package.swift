import PackageDescription

// HerdrKit is the transport + protocol layer for Herdr Companion.
//
// It deliberately contains NO UIKit/SwiftUI so it builds and tests on Linux.
// Default `swift test` does not use workstation SSH keys or Herdr sockets.
let package = Package(
    name: "HerdrKit",
    // REQUIRED, and its absence was invisible from Linux. With no `platforms`,
    // SwiftPM assumes macOS 10.10 and every modern-concurrency symbol this
    // package is built on becomes unavailable — Task, AsyncThrowingStream,
    // CancellationError, withTaskCancellationHandler, and the rest. Linux does
    // no availability checking at all, so the package compiled there while
    // being unbuildable on any Apple platform.
    //
    // The floors are chosen, not defaults: macOS 14 for the toolchain that runs
    // the tests (Citadel requires .macOS(.v14); a v13 floor fails `swift build`
    // on macOS with a dependency-floor mismatch — invisible on Linux, which
    // ignores `platforms:` entirely), iOS 17 because that is the floor the app
    // target will inherit and it decides which SwiftUI is available to the UI
    // work (and it matches Citadel's iOS floor, which is why iOS already builds).
    // `platforms` constrains Apple platforms only, so the "builds on Linux too"
    // property above is untouched.
